## Setting Up

A [guide for setup](https://llamapen.app/guide) is included on the site. We've tried to make setup as smooth and straightforward as possible, letting you configure once and immediately start chatting any time Ollama is running.

Once set-up, you can start chatting. All **chats are stored locally** in your browser giving you complete privacy and near-instant chat load times.

## Contributing/Running Locally

Contributing/running locally is also made as straightforward as possible. To get a local version of LlamaPen running on your machine, follow these steps:

### 0. Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (1.2+)

### 1. Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImDarkTom/LlamaPen
cd LlamaPen
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
bun i
```

### 3. Run

If you want to run in **developer mode** and see changes in your code updated live, do:

```bash
bun dev
```

If you want to just **run locally** with no overhead, do:

```bash
bun run local
```

*That's it!* If you are contributing and using VSCode you can optionally install the extensions in the `extensions.json` file for a smoother development experience.

## LlamaPen Cloud

If you are using the [official site](https://llamapen.app/) (`https://llamapen.app`), you may choose to enable LlamaPen Cloud. LlamaPen Cloud is an optional service that lets you run the most powerful versions of the latest models using a cloud provider if you are not able to run them locally. While LlamaPen is free and open-source, LlamaPen Cloud offers an optional subscription for increasing rate limits and accessing more expensive models. 

For security reasons, LlamaPen Cloud is **not** open-source, however we strive to ensure your privacy (as outlined in the Cloud service [privacy policy](https://cloud.llamapen.app/privacy)), and the only time we have access to your chats is if you explicitly enable LlamaPen Cloud in the settings and send chat requests using one of the provided models. **No data is ever sent to LlamaPen Cloud if you do not enable it in the settings**.

## Donating

Funding to help development is always appreciated, whether that is through purchasing a subscription on LlamaPen API or donating directly, I will appreciate any sponsorship you give.
